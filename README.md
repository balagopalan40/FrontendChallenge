# Challenge

Give a fresh, interesting spin to exploring HackerNews articles. If you're not familiar with it, please head on to https://news.ycombinator.com/, it's an interesting place for developers to hang around anyways!

The simple and public API that they expose (https://github.com/HackerNews/API) let's you retrieve just about anything happening there. To be specific, their API lets you query **Show**, **Ask**, and **Jobs** articles as well as meta categories like **New**, **Top** and **Best** stories, and all the comments people post.

Things we're watching out for in your application:

  * **User Experience**: We're talking about how easy it is to jump between categories and previewing articles and discussions.
  * **Design**: We understand it's part of the user experience, but we'd like to stress on the design part specifically to understand your taste for typography, proportions, colors and everything design.
  * **Frameworks**: We'd love to see a single page application built using any popular JavaScript framework (we love React!), and it's a good plus if you use some form of bundling like Webpack, Browserify or anything. Another great plus would be the use of CSS frameworks like LESS/SASS.
  * **Code**: We'd like to see a simple codebase that is easy to understand and follow (the developer version of User Experience)
  
If you're up for the challenge, please fork this repository and complete all of your work in the forked repository.

Tip: GitHub pages (https://pages.github.com/) and Netlify (https://www.netlify.com/) are amazing free services to showcase your work live. Put up a link in your repository's README or in the description.

Note: All of the specifics mentioned like React, Webpack, LESS etc... are completely optional, so feel free to submit just about anything that you've done to improve on the existing HackerNews, see it just as a way to get to know each other

I ahve replicated the Hacker News site and deployed in the following link. I have also committed to gitHub all the files used to develop the website. Only the search feature i have not implemented , since the API for the search is not available from the documentation.

I have used Bootstrap and Angular js to design the website. Kindly review and provide your valuable feedback.
